Kansella is a self-counselling app that helps you discover yourself, change unwanted habits, and track your healing journey through daily reflection and progress tracking.

---
## **Product Overview**

Kansella is a **minimal**, personal self-counselling app designed to help users reflect on their actions, heal from unwanted habits, and visualize their progress.

It’s built for people who want to take charge of their self-improvement — quietly, privately, and purposefully.

---

## **Our Story**

Kansella was born from a simple question:

> *“What if you could counsel yourself before things got too heavy?”*

We realized self-improvement tools often feel like productivity trackers — Kansella is different.

It’s a safe, personal space for the **quiet moments of honesty** we have with ourselves. Those moments of *"Gosh! I ate unhealthy food again?", "I lied again, today, why?".*

More than that, you'll never stutter when your conscience blames you for repeating bad habits, 'cos you can track the days you did/didn't do it. You either brag or fix up. 

---

## **Why Kansella Matters**

Every day, people make small promises to themselves — to stop a bad habit, to do better, to heal — yet life moves fast, and they forget to track it. Kansella provides a gentle daily space for reflection and accountability, helping users see how far they’ve come and what still needs work.

> *It’s not about perfection — it’s about progress.*
